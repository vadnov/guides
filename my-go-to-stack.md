# Step by step guide to spin up a web service

## 1. Pick a domain name

I prefer to buy my domain names on [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.pxf.io/jv1x0). 
Namecheap.com provides an intuitive interface, competitive rates on domains, deals and other perks.

## 2. Pick a hosting

I use [DigitalOcean.com](https://m.do.co/c/c3fc8a016f6e) (use this link to get $100 credits towards your account).
You can get a virtual machine for as low as $5/mo. Using the link above you will get a hosting for almost 2 years for free!

## 3. Put your web app to the hosting

Depends on a technology there are multiple ways to put your app online. 
I created a little [guide here](https://github.com/vadnov/guides/blob/master/asp-net-core-vm.md) in case you are using ASP.NET Core as I do.

## 4. Protect your app

Every app needs a protection. There are plently options available. I prefer using CloudFlare.com as it has a free tier.
